This project was funded under [NSERC](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp).

#### Inspiration

The graph gallery was inspired by [rgraphicsgallery](http://rgraphgallery.blogspot.ca) and [rChartsGallery](http://rcharts.io/gallery/). The goal is to create a simple and organized visual index of ggplot2 graphs.

We are very interested in extending this current work in hopes of  reviving the dormant R Graph Gallery.
